**MM-ACT** is a unified model that integrates text, image, and action into a shared token space, performing generation across all three modalities. 
It adopts re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency.

This repository contains:
* Training pipelines and deployment scripts for one-step parallel decoding and re-mask parallel decoding strategies across three modalities: action, text, and image.
* Scripts for evaluation on LIBERO and Robotwin, as well as the data collection pipeline used for task planning annotation on Robotwin.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone Repo and Environment Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HHYHRHY/MM-ACT.git
cd MM-ACT

# Create environment
conda create -n mmact python=3.13
conda activate mmact

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
### 2. Dataset Preparation
* **LIBERO**
  
  We utilize LIBERO datasets from [Huggingface_LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot), and uses LeRobot datasets for loading robot data.
  Please download [LIBERO-Object](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lerobot/libero_object_image),
  [LIBERO-Spatial](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lerobot/libero_spatial_image),[LIBERO-Goal](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lerobot/libero_goal_image) and 
  [LIBERO-10](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lerobot/libero_10_image). For LIBERO-10, we also provide our task planning datasets in [LIBERO-10-task](huggingface_link).
* **RoboTwin**
  
  For RoboTwin datasets, we utilize a dataset sampling pipeline that includes task planning generation. You can download our [training datasets](huggingface_link) 
  or collect your own datasets with our pipeline in [Robotwin_subtask](github_link).
### 3. Model Weight Preparation
Download the base model weights from MMaDA: [MMaDA-8B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Gen-Verse/MMaDA-8B-Base) and expand the original model's action codebook (we use 2048):
```bash
python model_utils/resize_model_vocab.py --model ${origin_model_path} --out ${output_model_path} --num_new ${action_codebook_size}
```
## 🚀 Training

We provide training pipelines for both LIBERO and RoboTwin. You can refer to the explanations of the configuration settings in [configs_readme.md](configs/configs_readme.md).
Single-node training can be launched using accelerate:
```bash
accelerate launch \
  --config_file accelerate_configs/1_node_8_gpus_deepspeed_zero2.yaml \
  --main_process_port 8888 \
  training/{your_training_script}.py \
  config=configs/{your_training_config}.yaml
```
Multi-node training can be referenced from the script in [shell/training.sh](shell/training.sh) and adapted to the launch commands of your cluster.
For **LIBERO**, We provide three specific pipelines:

1.Text-Only Training: [training/train_mmact_libero_mmu.py](training/train_mmact_libero_mmu.py), which used in LIBERO-10 stage1 training.

2.Action-Only Training: [training/train_mmact_libero_action.py](training/train_mmact_libero_action.py) wich used in all of LIBERO benchmark for action training.

3.Mixed (Text & Action) Training: [training/train_mmact_libero_mix.py](training/train_mmact_libero_mix.py), which used in LIBERO-10 stage2 training.

For **RoboTwin**, we provide a unified mixed-modality pipeline in [training/train_mmact_robotwin_mix.py](training/train_mmact_robotwin_mix.py). 
You can achieve arbitrary modality combinations training by adjusting parameters in configs.

For real robot, You can first convert your real-robot data into the LeRobot format. 
Then refer to the [training/train_mmact_libero_action.py](training/train_mmact_libero_action.py) script to conduct real-robot data training.

## ⚡ Evaluation & Deployment
Our trained model weight can be found at: [MM-ACT-weight](huggingface_link])

For **LIBERO** evalutation, please refer to [experiment/experiment_readme.md](experiment/experiment_readme.md) for detailed instructions.

For **RoboTwin** evaluation, please follow [Robotwin_subtask](github_link) instructions.

For real-world deployment, please refer to the script provided at: [deployment/mmact_deploy.py](deployment/mmact_deploy.py)
